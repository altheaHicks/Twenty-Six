# Twenty-Six

A simple console program to play the classic dice game "Twenty-Six"

## Description

The game prints to the console. Program will request initial "bank amount" from user input and play a game of Twenty-Six. I used C++ to practice my proficiency in the language. The program demonstrates my understanding of basic OOP principles, particularly class implementation.

## Rules of Twenty-Six

Twenty-Six is a gambling game popular in the 1930s-50s.
The player chooses a number from 1 to 6 as his point number.  He then throws the ten dice 13 times.  His score is the number of times that his point number is thrown.
Payouts are determined by the score.
